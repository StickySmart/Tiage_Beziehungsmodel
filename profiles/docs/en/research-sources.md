- **2024 Scoping Review**: [Research on Polyamory and CNM](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jftr.12546)

### Key Findings
- Polyamorous individuals show **similar relationship quality** as Monogamous (Trust, Commitment, Love)
- Often **lower jealousy** and **higher sexual satisfaction**
- High communication requirements
- Greater personal growth opportunities

- **Self-Determination Theory** (Ryan & Deci): Autonomy as basic need

### Key Findings
- Singles report **highest autonomy levels**
- Singles are less extraverted and conscientious than Partnered
- Two happiest Single types:
  1. Romantically avoidant (often women)
  2. Casual Dating (often men)
- Autonomy = Key to well-being for Singles

## 8. Philosophical Foundations

### Robert Pirsig - Metaphysics of Quality

**Work**: Lila: An Inquiry into Morals (1991)

## 9. TIAGE Resonance Theory: Neuroscientific Foundations

### Core Thesis

> **Perception is based on vibrations and patterns. Resonance = Synchronicity between internal neural rhythms and external signals.**

### 9.1 Neural Rhythms & Synchronization

#### György Buzsáki - Neural Oscillations
- **Work**: "Rhythms of the Brain" (2006), Oxford University Press
- **Core Concept**: Gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) as basis for consciousness and binding

#### Wolf Singer - Temporal Binding
- **Work**: "Neuronal Synchrony: A Versatile Code for the Definition of Relations?" (1999), Neuron
- **Core Concept**: Synchronous oscillations bind distributed neural representations

### 9.2 Predictive Coding & Free Energy

#### Karl Friston - Free Energy Principle
- **Work**: "The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?" (2010), Nature Reviews Neuroscience
- **Core Concept**: Brain minimizes prediction errors through internal models

### 9.3 Aberrant Salience (Psychosis Model)

#### Shitij Kapur - Aberrant Salience
- **Work**: "Psychosis as a State of Aberrant Salience" (2003), American Journal of Psychiatry
- **Relevance for Resonance**: The TIAGE model describes a healthy form of "hyper-resonance"

### 9.4 Psychoacoustics & Emotion Regulation

#### Daniel Levitin - Music & Brain
- **Work**: "This Is Your Brain on Music" (2006), Dutton
