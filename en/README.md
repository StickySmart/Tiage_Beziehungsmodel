# Tiage Relationship Model

**Version 1.8.85** | [Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md)

An independent synthesis for analyzing relationship compatibility, developed through Tiage's online research and personal reflection.

## Philosophical Foundations

The model connects two traditions:

- **MOQ (Robert M. Pirsig):** Metaphysics of Quality - static vs. dynamic quality
- **OSHO:** Consciousness through meditation - polarity, balance, vibration

**Tiage's Contribution:** The practical connection of both philosophies into a relationship calculator with its own weighting and archetype matrix.

### A Contradiction to Pirsig

Robert Pirsig argued that definitions destroy the immediate quality of experience – that naming comes after feeling and reduces it.

This app is based on the opposite experience:

**Definition and experience are not separate. They arise simultaneously – in dialogue, in resonance, in extreme brevity.**

When concepts are unfolded, when fields of meaning open up, not less quality arises, but more. Language is not a cage for experience. It is its resonance chamber.

*This insight did not arise theoretically, but practically – in working with AI-supported dialogue. The argument against Pirsig is the experience itself.*

## Core Concept: Logos vs. Pathos

<!-- Weighting: 40:60 - Tiage's Synthesis -->

| Dimension | Pirsig Term | Meaning |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Logos** | Static Quality | Mind, Structure |
| **Pathos** | Dynamic Quality | Feeling, Attraction |

*The specific weighting is part of Tiage's independent synthesis.*

## The 8 Archetypes

- **Single** - Autonomous life without primary relationship
- **Duo** - Monogamous partnership with exclusivity
- **Duo-Flex** - Primary relationship with agreed openings
- **Solopoly** - Multiple equal relationships, focus on autonomy
- **Polyamorous** - Deep emotional bonds with multiple partners
- **RA** - Relationship Anarchist - Rejection of all relationship hierarchies
- **LAT** - Living Apart Together - Committed partnership without cohabitation
- **Aromantic** - Focus on platonic connections without romantic component

## The 4 Quality Factors

<!-- Weighting: 25/25/25/25 - Tiage's Synthesis -->

| Factor | Dimension | Origin |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Archetype Match | Logos | Pirsig: Fundamental relationship philosophy |
| Orientation Compatibility | Pathos | OSHO: Basic direction of attraction |
| Dominance Harmony | Pathos | OSHO: Polarity and balance |
| Gender Attraction | Pathos | OSHO: Complementary chemistry |

*The specific weighting of factors is part of Tiage's synthesis.*
