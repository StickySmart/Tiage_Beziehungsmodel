# Tiage Relationship Model

An independent synthesis by Tiage for analyzing relationship compatibility.

---

## Philosophical Foundations

The model connects two traditions through Tiage's online research and reflection:

### Robert M. Pirsig - Metaphysics of Quality (MOQ)
- **Static Quality** → Logos (Structure, Stability, Rules)
- **Dynamic Quality** → Pathos (Change, Growth, Feeling)

### OSHO - Consciousness through Meditation
- Awareness of polarity, balance, vibration
- Meditation as path to clarity
- Letting Go enables genuine connection

### TIAGE Resonance Theory - Neuroscientific Level

The philosophical concepts of Pirsig and OSHO are supported by neuroscientific research:

| Concept | Scientists | Meaning for Relationships |
|---------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Neural Synchronization** | Buzsáki, Singer | "Being on the same wavelength" = Gamma coherence in conversation |
| **Predictive Coding** | Friston | Compatibility = low "prediction errors" |
| **Salience Regulation** | Kapur | Flow vs. Hyper-synchronicity (Psychosis) |
| **Psychoacoustics** | Levitin | Music as external regulation system |
| **Sensory Sensitivity** | Aron | High sensitivity + stimulus load → state fluctuations |

## Core Concept: Logos vs. Pathos (25:75)

| Dimension | Weight | Pirsig Term | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Pathos** | 75% | Dynamic Quality | Feeling, Attraction, Intuition |
| **Logos** | 25% | Static Quality | Mind, Structure, Rules |

## The 8 Archetypes

| Archetype | Description | Color |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Single** | Autonomous life without primary relationship | Red (#E63946) |
| **Duo** | Monogamous partnership with exclusivity | Pink (#E84393) |
| **Duo-Flex** | Primary relationship with agreed openings | Coral (#FF6B6B) |
| **Solopoly** | Multiple equal relationships, focus on autonomy | Green (#2A9D8F) |
| **Polyamorous** | Deep emotional bonds with multiple partners | Orange (#F4A261) |
| **RA** | Relationship Anarchist - Rejection of all relationship hierarchies | Purple (#9B5DE5) |
| **LAT** | Living Apart Together - Committed partnership without cohabitation | Turquoise (#40E0D0) |
| **Aromantic** | Focus on platonic connections without romantic component | Gray (#708090) |

## The 8 Relationship Types

Each archetype can engage in different types of relationships. The model distinguishes 8 relationship types:

| Type | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Acquaintance** | Acquaintance | Non-binding social contacts, broad network |
| **Friends** | Friends | Trusted connections without romantic component |
| **FwB** | Friends with Benefits | Friendship with physical intimacy |
| **Casual** | Casual | Spontaneous encounters without commitment |
| **Romantic** | Romantic | Emotional depth, romantic connection |
| **Partner** | Partner | Complete relationship on all levels |
| **Nesting** | Nesting Partner | Cohabiting partners, shared daily life |
| **Soulmate** | Soulmate | Deepest connection, transcendent resonance |

## The 4 Quality Factors

### 1. Orientation Compatibility (40% - Pathos)
Physical polarity and attraction (Hetero, Homo, Bi, Pan, Ace)
"Pathos before Logos" - People experience relationships physically first

### 2. Archetype Match (25% - Logos)
Fundamental relationship philosophy: "How do we want to live relationships?"

### 3. Dominance Harmony (20% - Pathos)
Energetic dynamic: Dominant, Submissive, Switch, Balanced

**Scientific Foundation:**

| Constellation | Score | Research Evidence |
|---------------|-------|-------------------|
| Complementary (Dom ↔ Sub) | 100% | Tiedens & Fragale (2003): Complementarity leads to more sympathy and comfort |
| Balanced ↔ Balanced | 95% | Flexible dynamic without rigid hierarchy |
| Switch ↔ Switch | 90% | Situational role adaptation possible |
| Dom/Sub + Balanced | 85% | Stable complement with flexible partner |
| Switch + Dom/Sub | 80% | Adaptation possible, but tension |
| Dom ↔ Dom | 55% | Sadikaj et al. (2017): Power struggle risk, lower satisfaction |
| Sub ↔ Sub | 55% | Leadership vacuum, conscious task division needed |

OSHO: "Tao - one energy, two expressions"

### 4. Gender Attraction (15% - Pathos)
Gender chemistry as fine-tuning of orientation

## Profile Parameters

Profile parameters are all properties that define a user profile. They are divided into **Attributes** (fixed properties) and **Needs** (personal preferences).

### Overview

```
PROFILE PARAMETERS (umbrella term)
│
├── ATTRIBUTES (what you are - 4 main factors)
│   │
│   ├── Gender
│   │   ├── Primary: Body (Male, Female, Inter)
│   │   └── Secondary: Identity (Cis, Trans, Non-binary, Fluid, Searching)
│   │
│   ├── Orientation
│   │   ├── Primary: Sexual Attraction (who do I desire physically?)
│   │   │   └── Options: Heterosexual, Homosexual, Bisexual, Pansexual, Asexual
│   │   └── Secondary: Romantic Attraction (who do I fall in love with?)
│   │       └── Options: Heteroromantic, Homoromantic, Biromantic, Panromantic, Aromantic
│   │
│   ├── Dominance
│   │   └── Dominant, Submissive, Switch, Balanced
│   │
│   └── Archetype
│       └── Single, Duo, Duo-Flex, Solopoly, Polyamorous, RA, LAT, Aromantic
│
└── NEEDS (what you want - ~307 profile parameters)
    │
    ├── NVC Core Needs (88) - based on Marshall Rosenberg
    │
    ├── Life Topics (47) - practical relationship themes
    │   ├── Life Planning: Children, Marriage, Housing
    │   ├── Finances & Career: Money, Work-Life Balance

    │   └── ...
    │
    └── Philosophical Needs (81) - Pirsig/OSHO
        ├── Flow/Gumption (Pirsig)

## Main Formula (v3.1)

```
Q = (A × 0.15 × R_Philosophy) + (O × 0.40 × R_Life) + (D × 0.20 × R_Dynamics) + (G × 0.25 × R_Identity)
```

Each factor is multiplied by its **own resonance dimension**:

| Factor | Weight | × | Resonance |
|--------|--------|---|-----------|
| A (Archetype) | 15% | × | 🧠 R_Philosophy |
| O (Orientation) | 40% | × | 🔥 R_Life |
| D (Dominance) | 20% | × | ⚡ R_Dynamics |
| G (Gender) | 25% | × | 💚 R_Identity |

## Result Interpretation

| Score | Rating | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **70-100%** | Good | Solid foundation present |
| **50-69%** | Medium | Requires conscious effort |
| **0-49%** | Challenging | Fundamental differences |

*The quality index is a guideline value. Real relationships depend on many other factors.*
