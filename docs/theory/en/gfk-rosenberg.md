# Nonviolent Communication (NVC) according to Marshall B. Rosenberg

> *Foundation of the needs categories in the Tiage Relationship Model*

## About Marshall B. Rosenberg (1934-2015)

**Marshall B. Rosenberg** was an American psychologist who developed **Nonviolent Communication (NVC)**. His approach is based on the belief that all humans have the same universal needs and conflicts arise when these needs are not met.

**Main work**: *Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life* (2003)

---

## The NVC Needs Model

### The Four Steps of NVC

1. **Observation** - What do I perceive? (without judgment)
2. **Feeling** - What do I feel about it?
3. **Need** - What need is behind it?
4. **Request** - What do I specifically wish for?

### Application in the Tiage Model

The Tiage Model focuses on **Step 3: the needs**. These form the foundation for calculating compatibility between two people.

## Tiage Extensions

### Category 11: Dynamics & Exchange

The first extension is based on BDSM/kink research:

```
Sources:
├── Dossie Easton & Janet Hardy: "The New Topping Book" (2003)
├── Dossie Easton & Janet Hardy: "The New Bottoming Book" (2001)
└── Jay Wiseman: "SM 101: A Realistic Introduction" (1996)
```

```
Needs:
├── exercising_control
├── devotion
├── providing_leadership
├── being_led
├── ritual
├── aftercare
├── setting_boundaries
├── respecting_boundaries
├── intensity
└── ...
```

**Relevance**: This category enables modeling of dominance dynamics (dominant/submissive/switch).

## Statistical Integration

### Gaussian Distribution of Needs Values

Every needs value in the Tiage Model represents the **expected value (μ)** of a normal distribution:

```
P(μ - 1.28σ ≤ X ≤ μ + 1.28σ) = 0.80

→ 80% of people with the same trait combination
   fall within this interval
```

---

## Rosenberg's Philosophy in Tiage Context

### Core Principles

1. **No Judgment** - Needs are neutral, not "good" or "bad"
2. **Universality** - All humans have the same basic needs
3. **Strategies vs. Needs** - Needs are constant, strategies vary
4. **Empathy** - Understanding one's own and others' needs

### Application in Matching

| NVC Principle | Tiage Implementation |
|---------------|----------------------|
| No Judgment | Score is not a quality statement |
| Universality | Same 150+ needs for all profiles |
| Strategies vs. Needs | Archetypes = strategies, Needs = values |
| Empathy | Compatibility = overlapping needs |

---

## Critical Appraisal

### Strengths of the NVC Basis

- **Scientifically founded** - Decades of research and application
- **Cross-cultural** - Universal needs
- **Practice-oriented** - Direct application in conflict situations
- **Non-pathologizing** - No "wrong" needs

### Limitations

- **Western perspective** - Developed in Western context
- **Individual focus** - Collectivist cultures underrepresented
- **Dynamics extension** - BDSM category not from Rosenberg
- **Quantification** - Rosenberg worked qualitatively, not with scores
