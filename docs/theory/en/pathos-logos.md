# Pathos and Logos in the Tiage Model

> *The dual structure of relationship quality*

## Basic Concept: 15:85 Weighting

The Tiage Model divides relationship quality into two fundamental dimensions:

| Dimension | Share | Origin | Pirsig Term |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Pathos** | 85% | Feeling | Dynamic Quality |
| **Logos** | 15% | Mind | Static Quality |

## Logos (15% - Mind)

The rational, structure-giving dimension.

### Properties

- Proven patterns that create stability
- Rational decision-making foundations
- Structural compatibility
- Long-term predictability

### Manifestation in the Model

**Archetype Match (25% of total score)**

The fundamental relationship philosophy: *"How do we want to live relationships?"*

- Single ↔ Polyamorous = low match
- Duo ↔ Duo-Flex = high match

## Pathos (85% - Feeling)

The emotional, attracting dimension.

### Properties

- Force for change and growth
- Spontaneous attraction
- Emotional resonance
- Energetic dynamic

### Manifestation in the Model

| Factor | Share | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Orientation Compatibility** | 25% | Physical polarity and attraction |
| **Gender Attraction** | 25% | Gender chemistry and identity resonance |
| **Dominance Harmony** | 25% | Energetic dynamic (Tao) |

## Philosophical Foundations

### Pirsig: Static vs. Dynamic Quality

- **Static Quality (Logos):** Structured, repeatable patterns
- **Dynamic Quality (Pathos):** Creative force for growth

### OSHO: Awareness and Polarity

> *"Only extremes can truly attract each other."*

> *"Tao - one energy, two expressions."*

## The Balance Calculation

In the resonance factor, the relationship between Logos and Pathos is measured:

```
Logos = A (Archetype Score)
Pathos = (O + D + G) / 3

Balance (B) = (100 - |Logos - Pathos|) / 100
```

### Example

- Archetype Score (A): 72%
- Average O, D, G: 65%
- Difference: |72 - 65| = 7
- Balance: (100 - 7) / 100 = **0.93**

A high balance (close to 1.0) means: Head and heart are in harmony.

## Why 85% Pathos?

The model weights emotional factors higher because:

1. **"Pathos before Logos"** - People experience relationships first emotionally/physically (chemistry, attraction)
2. **The archetype question comes later** - "How do we want to live relationships?" only arises after the initial Pathos factors
3. **Zen/Osho perspective** - Accept what IS (the felt attraction), then follows the conscious choice
4. **Relationships primarily work through feelings** - Logic alone doesn't create attraction
