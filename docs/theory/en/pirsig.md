## About Robert M. Pirsig (1928-2017)

The creative force for growth and change.

- Spontaneity in relationships
- Emotional depth
- Development potential

## Literature

### Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (1974)

**Original title:** *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values*

A philosophical novel that represents Pirsig's first exploration of Quality as a metaphysical concept. The book combines a motorcycle journey with profound philosophical reflections on rationality, romanticism, and the nature of Quality.

### Lila: An Inquiry into Morals (1991)

**Original title:** *Lila: An Inquiry into Morals*

The continuation and systematic elaboration of the Metaphysics of Quality. Here Pirsig develops a complete philosophical theory that distinguishes static and dynamic quality patterns on biological, social, and intellectual levels.

## Tiage's Contradiction to Pirsig

Robert Pirsig argued that definitions destroy the immediate Quality of experience – that naming comes after feeling and reduces it.

This app is based on the opposite experience:

> **Definition and experience are not separate. They arise simultaneously – in dialogue, in resonance, in extreme brevity.**

When concepts are unfolded, when fields of meaning open up, not less Quality arises, but more. Language is not a cage for experience. It is its resonance chamber.

*This insight did not arise theoretically, but practically – in working with AI-supported dialogue. The argument against Pirsig is the experience itself.*
